# Bohr Atom Simulation 

A comprehensive and interactive simulation of the Bohr model of an atom using Flask, Python, React, JavaScript, and Three.js. This project is ideal for educational purposes, providing a visually engaging way to understand atomic structures according to the Bohr model.

## Overview 

This project consists of two main parts:

1. The backend, which is built with Flask and Python. It handles data manipulation and the logic behind the simulation.

2. The frontend, which is built with React and JavaScript. It provides an interactive user interface, with 3D visuals powered by Three.js.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the development environment running:

1. **Backend**
    ```bash
    cd be
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python3 api.py
    ```

2. **Frontend**
    ```bash
    cd ui
    yarn install
    yarn start
    ```

## Usage

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to view and interact with the simulation.
